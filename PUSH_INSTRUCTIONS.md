# Instructions for Pushing to GitHub

Now that you've created your local Git repository, follow these steps to push it to GitHub:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/ and sign in (or create an account if you don't have one)
2. Click the "+" button in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository "domain-value-predictor"
4. Optionally add a description
5. Keep it as a Public repository (or select Private if you prefer)
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these locally)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions. Use these commands to connect and push:

```bash
# Connect your local repository to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/domain-value-predictor.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 3. Alternative: Push to Another Git Provider

If you're using GitLab, Bitbucket, or another Git provider, the commands will be similar but the URLs will be different:

### For GitLab:
```bash
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/YOUR-USERNAME/domain-value-predictor.git
git push -u origin master
```

### For Bitbucket:
```bash
git remote add origin https://bitbucket.org/YOUR-USERNAME/domain-value-predictor.git
git push -u origin master
```

## 4. Using Hostinger Git Deployment

If you're deploying to Hostinger using Git, you'd use their repository URL:

```bash
git remote add hostinger ssh://u123456789@123.123.123.123:21098/home/u123456789/domains/yourdomain.com/public_html/
git push -u hostinger master
```

Replace the SSH details with the ones provided by Hostinger in their Git deployment section.

## 5. Authentication

When pushing to GitHub for the first time, you'll be prompted to authenticate. Use one of these methods:
- Personal Access Token (recommended)
- GitHub CLI
- SSH keys

Follow GitHub's prompts for authentication when you push.
